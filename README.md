This repository contain all the tasks which I have done as an intern in Data Science and machine learning from Sparks Foundations


# Task 2
The task at hand was to use a linear regression model to predict the scores of students based on the amount of time they spent studying.


# Task 4
The purpose of this task was to create a Decision Tree Classifier, so that if any new data added, the model would be able to predict the right species based on the parameters.

In addition to creating a decision tree classifier, I created an app using Streamlit in which the viewer can input his/her own values for the parameters to determine the species. The code can be viewed in the iris_app.py file.
